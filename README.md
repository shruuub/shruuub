### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I also mainly switched to [gitea](https://git.habedieeh.re/shruub) repo-wise, still active on here for comments etc.

ah yes, I do stuff that works unless it doesnt basically 
<p>yeah</p>
visit https://shruubo.ml while you're at it, pretty cool imo 
<p> Also yea, I kinda just use that account for contributing and like doing stuff with gh actions yes tf I never did anything with actions why am I</p>
